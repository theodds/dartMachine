===========

This is a fork of the bartMachine package with details listed below, designed for use in high-dimensional, sparse, settings. Of course, any bugs here are my own. For details, see [Linero (2016). Bayesian Regression Trees for High Dimensional Prediction and Variable Selection. Journal of the American Statistical Association. To appear](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2016.1264957).



Instructions

For detailed instructions on installation, see the instructions on the [bartMachine](https://github.com/kapelner/bartMachine/) repository. This package is not available on CRAN, and must be installed by compiling from the source.
